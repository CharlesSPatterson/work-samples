# Work Samples

This repository will serve as a hub for development work that I've done over time that I'm open to sharing. Certain directories or projects labeled as ARCHIVE will not be updated and instead kept in the same state that they were produced and submitted in.

- [Fanduel Assessment](https://github.com/CharlesSPatterson/work-samples/tree/main/fanduel-assessment-CSP) (**ARCHIVE**)

  - This was a take home assessment for the second round that I completed for FanDuel in early 2019. I continued onto the third and final round on site where I was unsuccessful. This was prior to my first professional experience in software development as a Senior Data Engineer for 2 years.
  - In order to run this repo, you'll need to ensure that you have flask and flask-restful installed. You can install them with the following commands:

          pip install flask
          pip install flask-restful

  - The most revelant files to look at would be the following:
    - [The Jupyter Notebook Writeup](https://github.com/CharlesSPatterson/work-samples/blob/main/fanduel-assessment-CSP/FanDuel%20Assessment%20Writeup.ipynb) (it's a bit long for an online preview, you may have to download it to see the full notebook)
    - [api.py](https://github.com/CharlesSPatterson/work-samples/blob/main/fanduel-assessment-CSP/fanduel-app/api.py)
    - [nba.py](https://github.com/CharlesSPatterson/work-samples/blob/main/fanduel-assessment-CSP/fanduel-app/resources/nba.py)
    - [DepthCharts.py](https://github.com/CharlesSPatterson/work-samples/blob/main/fanduel-assessment-CSP/depthcharts/DepthCharts.py)

- SDIO-GO-CLIENT
  - At one point, I was interested in learning Golang and was trying to make a fantasy sports simulation engine using a random sports data api I found online. This code is incomplete, I may update this in the future and the api key has likely been deactivated as I haven't used it in almost a year at the time of this writing.
  - Files of interest are the following:
    - [players.go](https://github.com/CharlesSPatterson/work-samples/blob/main/sdio-go-client/src/nfl/sports-data/player-feeds/players.go)
    - [teams.go](https://github.com/CharlesSPatterson/work-samples/blob/main/sdio-go-client/src/nfl/sports-data/team-feeds/teams.go)
